## About the Project

**KisanCall** is a voice-first procurement coordination platform for agricultural mandis and government procurement centres. It gives every farmer — including those without a smartphone or reliable data connection — a single conversational way to know their registration status, their procurement slot, their live position in the queue, the day's government-reported mandi price, and the status of their payment, through a **phone call, SMS, or a lightweight app.**

Underneath the conversational layer sits **AgroChain**, a narrow blockchain-anchored proof layer that timestamps and hashes the key events of a farmer's transaction — price agreed, quantity verified, procurement completed, payment confirmed — so that once a transaction is recorded, it cannot be silently altered. AgroChain never stores personal or financial data on-chain; it only anchors a cryptographic fingerprint of each critical event.

> **The core idea in one line:** KisanCall tells the farmer what is happening; AgroChain proves what happened.

The problem isn't that Indian agriculture lacks digital systems — procurement portals, mandi trading platforms, and government dashboards already exist. The problem is that the farmer's *experience* of those systems is fragmented, requires literacy and connectivity to use, and gives no way to independently verify that a transaction record is authentic. KisanCall closes that last-mile trust and accessibility gap by sitting **above** existing procurement infrastructure, not replacing it.

| Dimension | Assessment |
|---|---|
| Core users | Smallholder and marginal farmers registering for government/mandi procurement |
| Primary interface | Outbound/inbound AI voice call, SMS fallback, lightweight mobile & web app |
| Trust layer | AgroChain — selective blockchain anchoring of transaction events |
| Deployment model | Sits above existing procurement systems; doesn't require replacing them |
| Languages at launch | Hindi and English, with a roadmap to major regional languages |
| Differentiator | One conversational journey across registration, slot, queue, price, payment, and proof |

---

## The Problem

### The Real-World Workflow

A farmer engaging with a procurement centre typically moves through the following stages, regardless of which state or scheme is involved:

1. Procurement window is announced by the government or procurement agency
2. Farmer completes registration, KYC, and crop/land verification
3. Farmer is allotted a procurement centre, token, or slot
4. Farmer travels to the centre — often without a reliable idea of timing
5. Gate entry and arrival registration
6. Waiting in queue, weighing, and quality assessment
7. Procurement transaction and lot/bill entry
8. Payment processing
9. Farmer repeatedly checks or travels back just to confirm payment status

Every one of these steps generates information that's useful to the farmer — but today that information is scattered across portals, SMS, staff conversations, and physical visits. **The farmer bears the cost of stitching it together.**

### Farmer Pain Points

| Pain point | What the farmer actually needs | How KisanCall responds |
|---|---|---|
| Uncertain arrival time | A clear slot and a useful arrival window | Slot confirmation call/SMS plus a reminder before the window |
| Long physical waits | Live visibility of queue position | Real-time queue position and estimated wait time, updated by voice on demand |
| Sudden schedule changes | Immediate notice without having to check anything | Proactive outbound call or SMS the moment a change is recorded |
| Price uncertainty | Current, dated, sourced mandi reference price | Government-reported price read out with date and source |
| Payment uncertainty | A plain-language status, not a portal screen | AI explains payment status in the farmer's own language |
| Low smartphone comfort | No new app or workflow to learn | Phone call is the primary channel; app is optional |
| Poor rural connectivity | A channel that still works with 2G or no data | Voice and SMS require no data connection |
| Trust in digital records | Evidence that a transaction was actually recorded as agreed | A transaction reference the farmer can quote back, anchored via AgroChain |

---

## What We're Not Claiming

This project deliberately avoids overstating the problem. Digital procurement infrastructure already exists in India (e-NAM, state portals like Punjab's Anaaj Kharid, MP's e-Uparjan, Haryana's Meri Fasal Mera Byora), mandi trading platforms already support electronic payments and lot tracking, and government-backed multilingual voice assistants for farmers are already emerging.

**KisanCall is not positioned as the first digital tool for farmers** — it is positioned as a focused **coordination and trust layer** for the procurement journey specifically, built to be voice-first and independently verifiable.

---

## Our Solution & USP

KisanCall is built around three ideas held together tightly:

- **Voice as the primary interface, not an add-on** — a farmer can complete every core task by receiving or making a phone call
- **Proactive communication** — the system calls the farmer *before* the farmer has to ask a question
- **Verifiable proof** — the outcome of a procurement transaction is anchored on-chain so it cannot be silently altered after the fact

| USP | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| Single conversational journey | Registration, slot, queue, price, and payment handled in one flow instead of five disconnected systems |
| Smartphone-optional by design | The primary channel is a phone call; the app and web dashboard are conveniences, not requirements |
| Proactive, not reactive | System reaches out automatically at every meaningful status change — no need to repeatedly check or travel |
| Tamper-evident transaction proof | Selected events are hashed and anchored on-chain, giving a durable, independently checkable reference — without exposing personal or bank data |
| Grounded, hallucination-resistant AI | The voice agent only ever answers from live backend data through tool calls; it never invents a price, queue position, or payment status |
| Natural-language, zero-menu voice UX | Farmers ask in their own words ("mera number kab aayega?") instead of navigating a keypad-driven IVR tree |

> *KisanCall is a procurement-centre coordination and trust layer for farmers — reachable by a simple phone call, proactive by default, and backed by tamper-evident proof of what actually happened.*

## End-to-End Farmer Journey

1. Farmer registers by voice call or through the app
2. System identifies the farmer's preferred mandi and crop
3. Farmer is offered an available procurement slot
4. An AI call or SMS confirms the slot along with the current reference price
5. Farmer travels to the centre; staff mark the farmer as **Arrived**
6. The queue engine computes live position and estimated wait time
7. Crop is weighed and verified; a procurement record is created
8. The backend builds a proof record and anchors a hash of the key fields through AgroChain
9. Procurement status becomes **Completed**
10. Payment status moves to **Processing**, then **Paid**
11. An AI call proactively informs the farmer of the latest status
12. Farmer can request the transaction/proof reference at any time, by voice or in-app

## Workflow Visualizations

### 1. Registration — One Record, Two Entry Points

Both channels write to the exact same backend endpoint, so there is no divergent "app version" and "voice version" of a farmer's record.

```
   Farmer via Mobile App              Farmer via Voice Call
   (taps Register)                    ("mera naam Ramesh hai...")
            │                                    │
            └──────────────┬─────────────────────┘
                            ▼
                  POST /farmers
                            │
                            ▼
                  farmers table (Supabase)
                            │
                            ▼
              Staff Dashboard "Today" view
              updates instantly (Realtime)
```

### 2. Slot Booking

```
  Farmer picks a date/time         OR       Farmer tells the AI naturally
  (tap in app)                              ("mujhe kal subah aana hai")
            │                                          │
            └────────────────────┬─────────────────────┘
                                  ▼
                         POST /bookings
                                  │
                                  ▼
                 bookings row created — status: BOOKED
                    token number assigned
                                  │
                                  ▼
                  Supabase Realtime push
                                  │
                    ┌─────────────┴─────────────┐
                    ▼                             ▼
        Staff Dashboard live queue        Farmer app / call confirms
              view updates                  slot + today's price
```

### 3. Live Queue Tracking

```
  Status progression (per booking):

  BOOKED ──► ARRIVED ──► IN_QUEUE ──► PROCURED

     Each transition writes a queue_events row
     (farmer's live position + estimated wait time)
                       │
                       ▼
        ┌──────────────────────────────┐
        │      Supabase Realtime         │
        └──────┬────────────────┬────────┘
               ▼                ▼
      Mobile app updates    Voice AI answers
      position with no      "where is my number"
      manual refresh         by querying the same table
```

### 4. Payment Tracking

```
   Booking reaches PROCURED
             │
             ▼
   payments row created — status: PENDING
             │
             ▼
   status: PROCESSING  ─────►  status: PAID
             │                        │
             ▼                        ▼
   Visible identically on:   On PAID → AgroChain transaction
   - Staff Dashboard          hashes + anchors the event as a
   - Farmer app status screen tamper-evident proof record
   - Voice AI (on request)
```

### 5. Reminders & Notifications

```
   Backend detects an upcoming slot / a status change
                       │
                       ▼
        Outbound call or SMS triggered automatically
                       │
             ┌─────────┴─────────┐
             ▼                   ▼
      Call answered        Call not answered
             │                   │

## System Architecture

<div align="center">
<img src="./assets/architecture-animated.svg" alt="KisanCall animated system architecture — farmer phone and mobile app and staff dashboard feeding into the backend, which fans out to Supabase, the voice AI pipeline, and the AgroChain proof builder" width="850">

<sub>Animated SVG — lines pulse to show live data flow. If it renders as static in your viewer (some IDEs and PDF exports don't run SVG animation), the plain-text version below shows the identical structure.</sub>
</div>

### Architectural Principle

The system is **one backend brain reachable through several channels.** The mobile app, farmer web dashboard, staff dashboard, and phone call all query the same backend for the same facts. The operational database holds all live data. AgroChain only receives a narrow, pre-approved set of events to anchor.

### Data Flow for a Transaction Event

1. An operator marks a procurement stage complete on the staff dashboard
2. The backend writes the full record to PostgreSQL
3. The Event & Proof Builder canonicalises the relevant fields (event type, quantity, price, timestamp, transaction ID) and computes a hash
4. The hash and metadata are submitted to the AgroChain smart contract; the resulting transaction hash is stored back against the record
5. The farmer is notified by an outbound AI call or SMS, and can request the proof reference at any time

## Data Model

### Core Tables

| Table | Key fields |
|---|---|
| `farmers` | id, name, phone, language, preferred_mandi_id, crop |
| `mandis` | id, name, district, daily_capacity, working_hours |
| `slots` | id, mandi_id, date, start_time, end_time, capacity |
| `bookings` | id, farmer_id, slot_id, status, token |
| `queue_events` | booking_id, event_type, timestamp, sequence |
| `procurements` | booking_id, quantity, price, quality_status, status |
| `payments` | procurement_id, status, reference, updated_at |
| `price_cache` | mandi, commodity, min_price, max_price, modal_price, date, fetched_at |
| `calls` | farmer_id, direction, intent, outcome, duration, timestamp |
| `proof_events` | procurement_id, event_type, payload_hash, chain_tx_hash |
| `audit_logs` | actor, action, entity, old_value, new_value, timestamp |

### What Goes On-Chain vs Off-Chain

The guiding rule: **nothing personally identifying or financially sensitive is ever written to the public ledger.** Only a hash and minimal event metadata are anchored.

| Data | PostgreSQL (Supabase) | AgroChain (on-chain) |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Farmer name / phone / profile | | |
| Slot / queue data | | |
| Full payment details | | |
| Bank details | (encrypted) | |
| Transaction / event ID | | |
| Hash of selected transaction payload | | |
| Agreed quantity / price hash | | |
| Procurement completion event | | |
| Payment confirmation event hash | | |
| Timestamp / block reference | | |

## Voice AI Engineering

### Pipeline

```
Farmer speech
   → Telephony audio stream
   → Streaming Speech-to-Text (Deepgram)
   → Intent & tool selection
   → Backend tool call (get_slot / get_queue / get_price / get_payment / booking_create)
   → LLM composes a short answer strictly from tool output (Groq)
   → Streaming Text-to-Speech (Deepgram)
   → Farmer hears the response
```

### Context Design

Rather than loading a farmer's entire history and every FAQ document into the model, each call is given a **compact, structured context object** containing only what's relevant right now: `farmer_id`, `language`, `preferred_mandi`, `crop`, today's slot, queue position and ETA, latest price and its date, procurement status, payment status, and the outcome of the last call. This keeps responses fast, predictable, and grounded.

### Latency Targets

| Stage | Target | Approach |
|---|---|---|
| Speech capture | Continuous streaming | Detect end-of-speech quickly |
| Speech-to-Text | 100–400 ms incremental | Streaming STT with turn detection |
| Backend tool call | 50–250 ms | Indexed queries against the operational database |
| LLM time-to-first-token | 100–400 ms | Small, fast tool-calling model with concise prompts |
| Text-to-Speech first audio | 100–400 ms | Streaming TTS |
| **Perceived total response** | **0.5–1.5 s** | Stream partial audio; keep answers short |

### Barge-In

If the farmer starts speaking while the agent's audio is still playing, the agent **stops output immediately**, preserves conversation state, and returns to listening. This is treated as a first-class requirement — natural conversation depends on it.

### Grounding & Hallucination Control

- The LLM never invents a price, queue position, or payment status
- Every factual answer is retrieved through an internal tool call first
- If data is missing or stale, the agent says so and offers staff escalation instead of guessing
- Every price response includes its reporting date
- Every payment response is read from the authoritative `payments` table, never generated freely

## AgroChain — The Proof Layer

### Purpose

AgroChain exists to answer one question with confidence: **can the farmer trust that what the system says happened is what actually happened?** Blockchain anchoring is used narrowly, only for events where a durable, independently checkable record adds real value — it never substitutes for the operational database.

### Event Lifecycle

```
PROCUREMENT_CREATED → QUANTITY_VERIFIED → PRICE_CONFIRMED
   → PROCUREMENT_COMPLETED → PAYMENT_INITIATED → PAYMENT_CONFIRMED
```

### What Is Recorded per Event

- A unique transaction/event identifier
- A hash of the canonicalised transaction fields
- Event type and timestamp
- A pseudonymous actor/system identifier
- A reference to the previous event where relevant
- The resulting blockchain transaction hash

### Honest Limitations

A blockchain record cannot, by itself, prove that a physical weighing or a bank payment was conducted honestly — it can only make the recorded event significantly harder to alter after the fact. AgroChain is designed to **complement, not replace**, trusted staff processes, authentication, and weighing/quality evidence.

### Resilience

Proof writes are queued and submitted **asynchronously**, so a temporary blockchain network issue never blocks a farmer's procurement or payment flow. Failed writes are retried with idempotency keys to prevent duplicate anchoring.

## Security & Privacy

| Risk | Control |
|---|---|
| Phone number leakage | Role-based access, server-side masking, no public exposure |
| Identity document leakage | Minimise storage; rely on authorised identity systems where possible |
| Bank detail leakage | Encrypted at rest, never written to the blockchain |
| AI hallucination | Tool-first architecture; no free-form factual generation |
| False staff update | Role-based permissions and full audit logging |
| Queue manipulation | Server-side queue rules with an immutable audit trail |
| Blockchain key compromise | Secure secret storage; separate deployment and admin keys |
| Duplicate proof events | Idempotency keys on every proof submission |
| Third-party API outage | Caching with clear stale-data warnings |
| Wrong farmer record | Verified mobile number plus staff-assisted correction |
| Prompt injection via external data | External text/data treated as untrusted; strict tool allowlist |

## Conclusion

KisanCall is best understood as a carefully bounded digital public-service product, not a bundle of unrelated technologies. Government and market data give the system facts. The voice layer gives the farmer access without requiring literacy, a smartphone, or a data connection. The procurement engine coordinates the actual workflow at the centre. AgroChain anchors proof of what happened, so trust doesn't depend solely on taking the system's word for it.

> *KisanCall tells the farmer what is happening. AgroChain proves what happened.*
